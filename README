# Telescope Planner  [![Github commits (since latest release)](https://img.shields.io/github/commits-since/victordomingos/telescope-planner/latest.svg)](https://github.com/victordomingos/telescope-planner)

A simple utility for telescope time planning, for astronomy hobbyists. The aim is to provide an easy to use tool to help planning sky observation sessions, suggesting some of the interesting objects you may be able to watch at naked eye, or using amateur equipment (binoculars or small to medium size telescopes) in a given date/time and place.

Currently in an early stage.
